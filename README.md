### Read Club - Blog Application with MongoDB, Express, React and MongoDB

Read Club is a full-stack blog application that I designed and developed from scratch using the MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js. This app was driven not only by interest in web development, but also by personal passion for literature. This project is currently in active development.

Through this app, I was able to deepen my understanding of authentication, protect routes, RESTful API integration, and full-stack architecture, while also combining my love for code and creative writing.
